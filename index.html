      Dear, Ladybug. Here is what I have been working on these last few weeks (with lots of help from my friend ChatGPT).<br><br>
      Because we'll be apart for most of the month of january, I wanted to make you something that would make our days apart feel less distant. <br><br> A while ago, you said something about wanting to know more about the music I listen to. Well, I made you an advent calendar. One song a day, for the entire month of January. <br><br> There is no theme or genre. Most of them are just what I've been listening to recently, which happens to be lots of old canadian bands my Dad showed me. <br><br>I have also added brief descriptions/backgrounds for each song. The first few days have a further listening page but that was a pain in the ass to code and I didn't have enough time to do all of them, so I will send you the rest of the further listening songs by text on the day of.  I love you dearly, and I hope you enjoy.
