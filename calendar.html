    song: "Heroes of the Sidewalk",
    artist: "Two Hours Traffic",
    spotify: "https://open.spotify.com/track/61wG90GR2orG2nWT2UGP6t",
    cover: "day1.png",
    note: `Marcus played this song at his house in Cape Cod while we were making beef stew. A Nor'easter was blowing in and we were getting drunk on cheap Port that I bought with my fake ID at Trader Joe's, since it was the only place in town that wouldn't scan it. I had cheaped out years ago by opting for the un-scannable version of the ID, and have been living with the consequences ever since. 
I was chopping onions as the song came on and I found myself remembering all of the lyrics. My dad used to play it all the time while I was growing up and I hadn't heard it in years. It reminds me of us. This song feels like walking home together in the cold and silence while holding hands through gloves. I really like that line: "you're my idea of a lady, hold on to my bootstraps baby, and drag me around by your ponytail." (Despite your lack of a ponytail, you are my idea of a lady.) 
This song also reminds me of biking to your house in Montreal. I discovered that, when played back to back, this song and Daylight by Matt Kim (see further listening) would last the entire bike ride. I would always listen to Heroes of the Sidewalk first, and Daylight would end right as I jumped up the curb at your house. This was before the snow and the cold came and I could actually listen to music while I biked. Now, I'm lucky if I make it out of the house without leggings on. 
Two Hours Traffic are a band from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. I think my dad went to a show of theirs while he was at UBC in the mid nineties. Frankly, this is the only song of theirs that I am familiar with, but I think it is beautiful and if I was making a romantic movie I would put it in the soundtrack.|`,

    song: "Body of Years",
    artist: "Mother Mother",
    spotify: "https://open.spotify.com/track/6q5wsa7S7wyyFyvTXECtTg",
    cover: "day2.png",
    note: `This track, from Mother Mother's 2008 album O My Heart, is very special to me. Like yesterday's song, Body of Years was a frequent musical accompaniment to my childhood. Growing up in East Vancouver, in a little Vancouver Special on East 29th Avenue Between Mohawk and Knight, this album was often heard in the evenings as my Dad made dinner. It always makes me laugh capitalizing the D in Dad like that. Like that thing they do for God. (Google tells me it is called reverential capitalization.) Anyways, He would be making soup and Mom would be writing emails at the kitchen table and I would be doing some only-child activity, like playing with an imaginary friend or refusing to share, when that song would come on, and they would start to sing.  
Not the most fun lyrics ever, when you think about it, but nobody really listens to lyrics anyways. At least not me, when I was a kid. It was about singing them together, man.
With a minute and a half left in the song, the drums momentarily drop off and the tone shifts. Somber lyrics accompanied by piano begin the shift, then transition into a guitar solo. Its no Knopfler, but I'm still rather fond of it. Below, you will find two more songs from the same album that I am particularly fond of. The title track, O My Heart, features vocals from frontman Ryan Guldemond and explains the album's cover art (which I love), while Wrecking Ball is perhaps the catchiest song on the album, featuring a pretty little guitar intro and clever lyrics.`,

    song: "Back in Your Head",
    artist: "Tegan and Sara",
    spotify: "https://open.spotify.com/track/2Pdo1VvYDB9FqeuNx8D1FW",
    cover: "day3.png",
    note: `Just like the past two songs, Back in Your Head is special to me because I listened to it growing up. It is familiar.  It was only while doing the research for this post that I realized what the song is actually about. Namely,  a couple who have lost love for each other, but don't want to break up because they are comfortable. Even though it is probably intended to be a sad song, this one makes me happy because it takes me to memories of my childhood. 
This song in particular was on a playlist that Dad made for Mom called "Birthday Tunes for a Spicy Dish," and he would play it every time they hosted a party. This whole genre of music floated through my house for years. Even if I never stopped to listen to the lyrics, the melodies stayed with me. Very frequently, I will hum a song and not know anything about it, other than that I heard it a bunch as a kid. 
I asked my Dad about Tegan and Sara and he said that he discovered them from a group he was a part of that made mixtapes and sent them around. This is back in the olden days, when you could do that sort of thing. Back when Canada Post was reliable. Anyways, he says that an "interesting guy by the name of Brad" sent him this one CD that got pretty badly scratched up. He says he thinks Brad must have had a cat that woke up on the wrong side of the bed come mailing day. When Dad tried to play the CD, only the first couple songs played without stopping, and Tegan and Sara sang one of them. Dad says he loved them straightaway.`,

You will certainly know it. Formed in Liverpool in the late seventies, A Flock of Seagulls released this song on their first album in 1982. 

For me, this song is a walking song. If I'm walking somewhere and I want to get there quickly, I will throw on this song and match my steps to the bpm. It makes me think of being late somewhere. Like work, or class. If this song comes on and I'm just hanging out, it feels almost wrong. Like I have to speed up somehow. 

I love this song and I love bands with funny names. And I love you. Below, you'll find another great walking song.`, further: [{ title: "The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite — R.E.M.", url: "https://open.spotify.com/track/7tLTov4Ax1pyGcaV4qWrP5" }] },
  5: { title: "January 5th", song: "Perfect Day", artist: "Lou Reed", spotify: "https://open.spotify.com/track/4TOMI010Sd4ZAX4aZ5TS85", cover: "day5.png", note: `What a beautiful song. A good day is an odd topic to write a song about, but I'm so glad that Lou Reed did. I first found this song from watching Trainspotting. In the film, it is used ironically, playing over a montage of them doing heroin or running from cops or something. I almost think that is a misuse of the song. It's so damned pretty, I wish it could just be beautiful on it's own. 
When I listen to this song I think about us on exchange together. I can see it. We wake up in a beautiful city and maybe snow has fallen overnight. I make a coffee and you get a chai or some other local specialty and we sit in a bay window and do a crossword. Then we wander through the market and buy a warm snack for breakfast, something doughy and meaty and exotic smelling. After that, we go into a church and light candles for the people we love who have passed away (me, at the altar of St. Francis of Assisi, and you at the altar of Luke the Evangelist) When we are done we sit in a warm restaurant and order house wine and talk about movies and books until we're drunk and hungry. On the way home we stop at a butcher and buy ingredients for a stew that I make while reciting poetry that I have memorized. And you listen and look at me and smile and maybe (if it isn't too much to ask) scratch my back.

I love the way that his voice cracks when he sings "you just keep me hanging on."`, further: [{ title: "Lovely Day — Bill Withers", url: "https://open.spotify.com/track/0bRXwKfigvpKZUurwqAlEh" }] },
  6: { title: "January 6th", song: "Maggot Brain", artist: "Funkadelic", spotify: "https://open.spotify.com/track/5WJU527RQNyMLuKecjsL8V", cover: "day6.png", note: `So let's pivot. Today, we're talking Maggot Brain. We're talking insane guitar soloes. We're talking a 10 minute song. We're talking get high and lean back and close your eyes and listen to this masterpiece. 
I love this song. I talked to your brother about it and he said he liked it too, so I feel justified in recommending it. I never had a particularly good music taste. I don't really find new music. Every now and then somebody shows me a song and I listen to it on repeat for a week or two. And then I move on. I don't know much about bands, nor do I take care to attend concerts or listening parties. That being said, I freaking love this song. 
It's one of those songs that you need to dedicate your entire mind to. You can't run to this, or work out to it, or (god forbid) study to it. You must be present. If you are, it is freaking awesome. If not, it kinda sounds like a cat is attacking an alien microphone. 
This song makes me think about smoking the bong with you out of the balcony door that attached to your room in your old house. The cold air would get in and we would sprint back to bed and pull the covers up to our ears. This song makes me think about kissing you and feeling high and drunk and smelling your perfume and feeling the material of my jeans against my legs. Coming just two songs later on the same album, this next song is completely different. If Maggot Brain presents a raw, discordant, alien-sounding experiment in guitar, the rest of the album is much more commercial. There are vocals and recognizable melodies, and the like! Give it a listen, just to get a sense of what Funkadelic has to offer.`, further: [{ title: "Hit It and Quit It — Funkadelic", url: "https://open.spotify.com/track/2w7R3CQgvl8PIKJlwtT9Mv" }] },

I like songs that have lyrics about random stuff. Being lost in the supermarket is such a funny topic for a song. It’s only happened to me once, but I remember it very vividly. I got lost in Famous Foods, the store that I grew up going to with my dad every week. I can take you sometime. ", further: [] },

I was looking for stuff for our movie. Anyways, that’s not the point. He’s a super cool musician and from what I understand from google, he was never crazy famous. He played in a couple bands with famous people and stuff, but most of his discography was covers. This is one of his originals, and I really like it. ", further: [] },

I think it's starting to feel like home for both of us. Although it might make my parents sad to hear, when I hear this song I think about going home to Montreal with you.

The Kinks have funny voices and short, weird songs. The first song I ever heard of theirs was Waterloo Sunset and I really liked it. Since then I can’t say I’ve done anything close to a “deep-dive” of their music, but they will always have a special place in my heart for being funny and weird. ", further: [] },

When he came back he started playing a bunch of their music around the house, and it’s really cool. They have this awesome mix of female vocals, cool found audio that they repurpose, and the reggae style that they use in this song.

When I was in high school I would have math class next to the band room and every single time I had math class they would practice this song because the band teacher loved it and I probably heard it 500 times.

I hope this advent calendar has made the days go by a little quicker, and I cannot wait until I have you in my arms again. I love you, beautiful. ", further: [] }
